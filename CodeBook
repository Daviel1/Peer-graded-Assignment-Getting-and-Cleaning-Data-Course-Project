  ### Process

The script `run_analysis.R` performs the following process to clean up the data
and create tidy data sets:

1. Download the source data, unzip and read unzipped files.

2. Merge the training and test datasets to create a single database called 'dataset.txt'

3. Extract only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of 'dataset.txt'

4. Labels the data set with descriptive names.

5. Use the descriptive activity names to rename the activities in the dataset.

7. Finally, create a separate dataset called 'tidy_data.txt' which captures the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Variables

- activity - table contents of 'activity_labels.txt'
- activity_labels - names for data columns dervied from activity
- basedata - reshaped/melted data of 'dataset.txt'
- features - table contents of 'features.txt'
- subject_train - table contents of 'subject_train.txt'
- subject_test - table contents of 'subject_test.txt'
- subject - combined dataset of subject_train and subject_test datasets
- dataset - combined dataset of subject, activity datasets
- y_test - table contents of 'test/y_test.txt'
- y_train - table contents of 'train/y_train.txt'
- x_test - table contents of 'test/x_test.txt'
- x_train - table contents of 'train/y_train.txt'
- seconddatabase - subsetted, human readable data ready for output in accordance to project instructions.
  
  ### Output
  
`dataset.txt` is a 10299x79 data frame.

- The first column contains subject IDs.
- The second column contains activity names.
- The last 79 columns are measurements.
- Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30.

`seconddataset.txt` is a 180x81 data frame.

- The first column contains subject IDs.
- The second column contains activity names.
- The averages for each of the 79 attributes are in columns 3-81.
